### Jackpot-Python-V2
learning python so yea<br>
this version accepts X/Y/Z slots, each slot is independent from each other, meaning that it can have 8 different variations, instead of 3 (V1)

The code works similar as the V1 one, but this time each slot row and column can contain 1 to 3 emojis of the same type, allowing more variations.<br>
by the way, if you get Z1-Z3 + Y1 + X3, you are VERY lucky.<br>
